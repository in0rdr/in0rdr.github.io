Apart from my enthusiasm for open source software, I'm mainly interested in Distributed Ledgers, Relational Databases, Graph Theory, Reputation Systems and Infrastructure Automation (X as Code) in organizations.

In my spare time I like to go running, mountain biking or ski touring. Otherwise, you can find me in a closet tinkering with a [PowerEdge](https://www.dell.com/downloads/global/products/pedge/pedge_r815_specsheet_en.pdf).
