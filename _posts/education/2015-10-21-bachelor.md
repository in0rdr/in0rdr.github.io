### Bachelor Thesis: Resource Reallocation

The thesis entitled _"Investigation of Resource Reallocation Capabilities of KVM and OpenStack"_ reviewed concepts (e.g., page sharing, paging, memory ballooning, processor pining, queuing disciplines) and evaluated tools (e.g., libvirt, tc, cgroups) to reallocate memory, CPU cycles, disk I/O and network bandwidth on the hypervisor layer. The thesis documented existing resource reallocation capabilites of the Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) hypervisor module and explored mechanisms to facilitate similar tasks on the orchestration layer with an experimental OpenStack Compute (nova) extension.
